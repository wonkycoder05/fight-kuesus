# fight-kuesus

## Introduction

Welcome to Fight!!Kuesus, where people can fight against each other in the most satisfiying ways possible and vent out anger! This game packs funny sounds paired with smooth action -- as smooth as a pixel could be. 

## Things to Note:
1. Do note that the players will both freeze when they attack at the same time with each other.
2. The jump sound effect is one milisecond late and I do not know what to do. I can't possibly cut it since it's already only one second.
   

## Features
1. Fights: Fights are as smooth as it can be, though could bug at some specific movement.
2. Jumping mechanics are optimized to also include attacks, so players can swing their swords mid-air and jump around.
3. Scoreboards are also there to keep tabs on your wins! Can't let your rival beat you huh?
4. HP bars are there to visualize your damage. Be careful :D
5. There's no dodge or block mechanic. We love chaos.
   

## How to use:
1. Download Fight!!Kuesus zip.
2. Open the main file in VsCode or any other IDE that accepts python.
3. Press run, and the game should run.
4. The game loops infinetely, so do not worry.
5. The death mechanics here will not punish anything to the player, so don't be shy to get knocked out and have some fun!

## Requirements

1. A standard laptop with windows 10 or later.
2. a keyboard that's fully functional.
3. Two players to pit against each other.
